# BankingFraud
A common implementation of an LLM-based fraud detection system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves connecting an LLM to a bank's knowledge base. The LLM can then analyze real-time transaction data and provide human-readable, context-aware fraud alerts based on historical records, customer behavior, and policy documents. 

This sample code demonstrates the core components of a RAG pipeline for detecting unusual transactions across different banking areas. The example uses LangChain, a popular framework for building LLM applications, with a mock vector store and LLM for clarity. 
# 1. Setup: Data preparation and vector store creation
The RAG process begins by ingesting a set of relevant documents into a vector database. These documents—such as past fraud reports, bank policies, and customer history—become the "knowledge base" for the LLM

# 2. The RAG chain: Retrieval and generation
The RAG chain connects the customer query with the LLM and the vector store.
A query (e.g., a suspicious transaction) is received.
The query is used to search the vector store for the most relevant documents (e.g., bank policies and case studies).
The relevant documents are passed to the LLM as context.
The LLM generates a response based on the original query and the retrieved context

This sample illustrates the following RAG concepts for banking fraud:

# Cards: 
The analyze_card_transaction function retrieves the card policy and case study about a sudden large purchase, enabling the LLM to provide an explanation beyond simple rule-based systems.
# Loans: 
The analyze_loan_application function triggers retrieval of the policy concerning address mismatches, helping the LLM to pinpoint the exact reason for the fraud flag.
# Customer Authentication:
The analyze_authentication_event function retrieves the policy on failed login attempts and the case study of a stolen phone. The LLM then synthesizes this information to explain why the event is suspicious.
Payments: The analyze_payment function uses the RAG system to find the policy on large payments to new beneficiaries and provides a detailed rationale for the flagged transaction.
